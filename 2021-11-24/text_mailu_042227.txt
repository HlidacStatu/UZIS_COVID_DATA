On January 5, 2022, we’re making some changes to our Terms of Service.
These changes won’t affect the way you use Google services, but they’ll
make it easier for you to understand what to expect from Google — and what
we expect from you — as you use our services.

At a glance, here’s what this update means for you:

   - *More clarity on what you can expect from Google and what we expect
   from you*: We’re providing more examples to describe the mutually
   respectful conduct that we expect from all our users. We’re also providing
   more transparency about how we develop, improve, and update our digital
   content, services, and goods – including more detail about the reasons we
   make changes and legally-required updates, the advanced notice we provide
   to you, and your right to withdraw from your contract with us.
   - *Legal guarantee*: We’re summarizing the legal guarantees that you
   receive under EEA consumer laws when you use our digital content, services,
   and goods.
   - *Withdrawal right*: We’re providing information about your legal right
   to withdraw from the terms within 14 days of agreeing to them if you’re a
   consumer based in the European Economic Area (EEA). We’re also including a
   copy of the EU Model Instructions on Withdrawal in case you want to
   exercise that right.
   - *Additional definitions*: We’re adding more explanatory text to help
   you understand certain legal concepts that we refer to in our terms,
   including “commercial guarantee”, “legal guarantee”, and “lack of
   conformity”.
   - *Improved readability*: While our terms remain a legal document, we’ve
   done our best to make them easier to understand, including reorganizing
   some topics so that they’re easier to find.
